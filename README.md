# Library-Management-System
The Library Management System is a C++ project designed to efficiently manage library operations, including user authentication, book management, and borrowing/returning processes. It uses file-based storage to maintain data integrity and ensures seamless interaction for both customers and managers with role-based access control.

Features:

User Authentication: Secure signup and login system with role-based access for customers and managers.
Book Management: Add, search, and update book records with details like title, author, availability, and price.
Borrow and Return:
Tracks borrowed books with due dates and calculates a fine for late returns.
Displays comprehensive book details during borrowing and return processes.
Data Persistence: Uses CSV files for managing users, books, and borrowing history.
Modular Design: Built with Object-Oriented Programming principles, allowing easy scalability and maintenance.
Technologies Used:

Programming Language: C++
Concepts: File Handling, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
This project is ideal for understanding the implementation of core OOP concepts and file-based data management in C++.
